## Description
`gateCounts` is an R package for calculating cumulative gate counts,
provided raw daily gate counts and gate directionality. The package was developed to improve current methodologies for calculating cumulative gate counts. 


## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anjalisilva/gateCounts", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("gateCounts")
```

To run the Shiny app:
``` r
gateCounts::runGateCount()
```


## Overview

To list all functions available in the package:

``` r
ls("package:gateCounts")
```

`gateCounts` package contains 2 functions. The *gateCountCumulative* function calculates cumulative gate counts, provided a numeric vector or a tibble containing values of raw daily gate counts. The Shiny app employing *gateCountCumulative* could be run and results could be visualized using *runGateCount*. For more information, see details section below.

## Details

### Introduction
`gateCounts` is an R package for calculating cumulative gate counts,
provided raw daily gate counts and gate directionality. The package was developed to improve current methodologies for calculating cumulative gate counts. If gates are bidirectional, the cumulative sum calculated will be divided by two. Testing has shown that this method of dividing at the end of calculation will help reduce issues with gate counts that result from division of daily counts by two and rounding up or down. Further, negative counts can result during calculation if the counter has reset or if a lower value has been entered compared to previous day. The package attempts to correct for both scenarios. The package also ensures that counts for empty cells, when the daily count was forgotten to be reported, are accounted for.

## Shiny App  

The Shiny app employing could be run and results could be visualized:

``` r
gateCounts::runGateCount()
```
