## Description
`gateCounts` is an R package for calculating cumulative visitor counts, provided raw daily gate counts, gate directionality and gate counter maximum value. The package was developed for calculating cumulative visitor counts in libraries using daily gate counts. However, the package can be applied to calculate cumulative visitor counts from any setting. 


## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anjalisilva/gateCounts", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("gateCounts")
```

To run the Shiny app:
``` r
gateCounts::runGateCount()
```


## Overview

To list all functions available in the package:

``` r
ls("package:gateCounts")
```

`gateCounts` package contains 2 functions. The *gateCountCumulative* function calculates cumulative visitor counts, provided a numeric vector or a tibble containing values of raw daily gate counts. The Shiny app employing *gateCountCumulative* function could be run and results could be visualized using *runGateCount()*. For more information, see details section below. 

## Details

### Introduction
`gateCounts` is an R package for calculating cumulative visitor counts, provided raw daily gate counts, gate directionality, and gate counter maximum value. The package was developed to improve methodologies for calculating cumulative visitor counts. 

Negative visitor counts can result from calculation if the gate counter has reset. This package attempts to correct for this.

Negative visitor counts can also result from a lower gate count value has been entered compared to previous day. This package attempts to correct for this.

The package attempts to account for when the daily gate count has been forgotten to be reported. This method doesn’t assign counts for missed days, but rather adjust for cumulative visitor count sum.

The package checks for any  possible non-numeric characters (e.g., "turned off", "Diag 5", "Diag 9",  "closed", "Clean filter"), then adjusts for visitor count by taking past reported gate counts.

If gates are bidirectional, the cumulative visitor sum calculated will be divided by two. Testing has shown that this method of dividing at the end of calculation will help reduce issues with visitor counts that result from division of daily gate counts by two and rounding up or down.
