## Introduction

**gateCounts** is an R package for calculating daily, weekly, monthly, and cumulative visitor counts, provided raw daily gate counts, gate directionality, and gate counter maximum value. The package was developed to improve methodologies for calculating visitor counts from gate counts, initially using library daily gate count values as an example. However, the package can be applied to calculate visitor counts from any setting. The factors adjusted for are outlined below. To download **gateCounts**, use the following commands:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anjalisilva/gateCounts",     
                          build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("gateCounts")
```
To list all functions available in the package:
``` r
ls("package:gateCounts")
```

### Some Issues & How They Are Handled By Package

To calculate visitor counts from raw daily gate counts, today's gate count reading is subtracted from yesterday's reading. Negative visitor counts can result if the gate counter has reset. This package attempts to detect and correct for this.

Negative visitor counts can also result from a lower gate count value that has been entered compared to previous day. This may result from manual entry or system errors. This package attempts to detect and correct for this.

The package attempts to account for when the daily gate count has been forgotten to be reported or days are skipped. This method doesnâ€™t assign counts for missed days, but rather adjust for cumulative visitor count sum. See below for details:

The package checks for any  possible non-numeric characters (e.g., "turned off", "Diagnosis", "closed", "Clean filter"), then adjusts for visitor count by taking past, last reported gate count.

### Directionality
If gates are bidirectional, the visitor counts will be divided by two. For cumulative visitor count, our testing has shown that dividing by two after calculating all daily visitor counts helps to provide a better approximation of cumulative gate count, compared to when the daily visitor counts are divided by two and then summed up at the end. Therefore, for cumulative visitor counts from bidirectional gates, all daily visitor counts are summed at then divided by two. Hence, users may find slight differences between summing up daily visitor counts outputted by the package versus cumulative gate count outputted by the package.

## Calculates Daily Visitor Counts From Raw Daily Gate Counts

This package offers a function called **gateCountsToVisitorCounts** that calculates daily and cumulative visitor counts, provided a numeric vector or a tibble containing values of raw daily gate counts and date with a specific format. The function adjusts for several factors outlined above. 

``` r
set.seed(1234)
# Example 1: Unidirectional gates with daily counts
# Simulate gate count data using Poisson distribution
randomCounts1 <- c(sort(rpois(n = 50, lambda = 100)),
                  sort(rpois(n = 50, lambda = 1000)),
                  sort(rpois(n = 82, lambda = 100000)),
                  200000, # max value
                  sort(rpois(n = 50, lambda = 100)),
                  sort(rpois(n = 50, lambda = 1000)),
                  sort(rpois(n = 50, lambda = 100000)))

# Create a tibble with date information
randomCounts1tibble <- tibble::tibble(
                         dates = seq(lubridate::dmy('01-01-2022'),
                         lubridate::dmy('31-12-2022'),
                         by = '1 day')[1:length(randomCounts1)] %>%
                         format('%d-%m-%Y'),
                         counts = randomCounts1)

# Check max value for gate counter maximum
max(randomCounts1tibble$counts, na.rm = TRUE) # 200000

# Run gateCountsToVisitorCounts function to get visitor counts from gate counts
randomCountsEx1 <- gateCounts::gateCountsToVisitorCounts(
                    rawGateCounts = randomCounts1tibble,
                    gateType = "Unidirectional",
                    gatecounterMaxValue = 200000,
                    printMessages = FALSE)

randomCountsEx1$dailyVisitorCounts # access daily adjusted counts
randomCountsEx1$cumulativeVisitorCount # cumulative count for duration
randomCountsEx1$gatecounterMaxValue  # gate counter maximum
randomCountsEx1$gateType # type of gate

```
## Provide Visitor Count Summaries From Daily Visitor Counts

Now that visitor counts are present, either this or any user provided visitor count data could be used in the next function to generate summaries. The **visitorCountSummary** function can be used to calculate weekly, monthly visitor counts and summary statistics like daily, weekly, monthly mean and median, busiest and least busiest day, week, and month for the entire duration for which visitor count data is provided by user. Input should be a numeric vector or a tibble containing values of daily visitor counts and date with a specific format. See argument details using ?visitorCountSummary for more information.

``` r
# Check output and rename column for visitorCountSummary() function
# from above example
visitorCountsEx1<- randomCountsEx1$dailyVisitorCounts %>%
                   dplyr::rename("counts" = "visitorCount") %>%
                   dplyr::select(dates, counts)

# Use visitor counts to get summaries
visitorCountsEx1Summary <-
    gateCounts::visitorCountSummary(
    dailyVisitorCount = visitorCountsEx1)

# See the output
visitorCountsEx1Summary$dailyVisitorCounts # access daily counts
visitorCountsEx1Summary$weeklyVisitorCounts # access weekly counts
visitorCountsEx1Summary$monthlyVisitorCounts # access monthly  counts
visitorCountsEx1Summary$cumulativeVisitorCount # cumulative count for duration
visitorCountsEx1Summary$busiestMonth # busiest month
visitorCountsEx1Summary$leastBusiestMonth # least busiest month
visitorCountsEx1Summary$busiestWeek # busiest week
visitorCountsEx1Summary$leastBusiestWeek # least busiest week
visitorCountsEx1Summary$busiestDay # busiest day
visitorCountsEx1Summary$leastBusiestDay # least busiest day
visitorCountsEx1Summary$dailyAverage  # daily average for duration
visitorCountsEx1Summary$dailyMedian  # daily median for duration
visitorCountsEx1Summary$weeklyAverage # average based on weekly counts
visitorCountsEx1Summary$weeklyMedian # median based on weekly counts
visitorCountsEx1Summary$monthlyAverage # average based on monthly counts
visitorCountsEx1Summary$monthlyMedian # median based on monthly counts
```

## Visualize Daily Visitor Counts For One Institute

The **visitorCountsVisDaily** function that permit to create plots showing daily visitor counts for one institute. Plots include line plots and barplots of month vs daily counts. Plots with log-transformed counts are also provided to better visualize trends with outliers.

``` r
# Visualize visitor counts using visitorCountSummary() function
# First, format the table
visitorCountsEx1 <-
       randomCountsEx1$dailyVisitorCounts %>%
       dplyr::rename("counts" = "visitorCount") %>%
       dplyr::select("dates", "counts")
       
# Visualize daily values
visCountsEx1daily <-
    gateCounts::visitorCountsVisDaily(
    dailyVisitorCount = visitorCountsEx1)
       
# Navigate using arrows to look through different plots.
```

## Visualize Daily Visitor Counts of Multiple Institutes

If the visitor counts are available for multiple institutes over the same date range, the **visitorCountsMultipleVisDaily** function can be used to create plots showing daily visitor counts for multiple institutes. Plots include line plots and barplots. Plots with log-transformed counts are also provided to better visualize trends with outliers.

``` r
set.seed(1234)
# Example 1: Unidirectional gates with daily counts
# Simulate gate count data using Poisson distribution
randomCounts1 <- c(sort(rpois(n = 50, lambda = 1000)),

                   sort(rpois(n = 50, lambda = 100)),
